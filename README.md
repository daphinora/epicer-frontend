# EPICER FRONTEND
Welcome to Epicer, a weekly meal planning app! This project is still in the works. Come back later for more information!

Check out the Rails API backend for this project at https://github.com/daphinora/epicer_backend.

Welcome to Epicer! Epicer allows for easy browsing and searching through recipes to add to a weekly menu. Epicer was a graduation project by Jack Mitchell at Flatiron School and thus has still has many ongoing updates and features being added.

Want to try the app yourself? Clone this repo, cd into its directory, and then run `npm i && npm start`. Don't forget to run the backend found at https://github.com/daphinora/epicer_backend, too!! (Please keep in mind that no outside edits will be pulled/pushed to the main branch/project. Any edits you make to your clone will remain on your clone.)

Please note that all user authentication has been disabled for this app.

Stretch goals for this project include:

- Add a shopping list to which users may add needed ingredients from a recipe
- Add a pantry in which the user can store information about ingredients currently owned
- Allow multiple users from the same household to alter the same menu (or offer edit/recipe suggestions)
- Allow users to add their own recipes to the Epicer database
- Allow users to keep track of their progress through a recipe's instructions by clicking on steps to disable or strike through them
